# ModelingOntology

An ontology to support analytical investigations of manufacturing processes.

The ontology imports QUDT, dtypes, vaem and (at least temporarily), a statistics ontology. We maintain our own copies of these due to problems we encountered in the linkedmodel.org versions of these. Note that we are using the 1.1 version of QUDT, so this problem needs to be revisited. (V2 was released 2016-09-18).
