# ModelingOntology

An OWL ontology to support analytical investigations of manufacturing processes. The ontology is composed of two files:
 * [modeling.ttl](https://github.com/usnistgov/ModelingOntology/blob/master/modeling.ttl) defines the upper-level ontology.
 
 * [operations.ttl](https://github.com/usnistgov/ModelingOntology/blob/master/operations.ttl) defines concepts for modeling production systems. (It has an operations research focus.)
